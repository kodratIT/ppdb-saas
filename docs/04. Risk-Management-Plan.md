## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document identifies potential risks that could impact the PPDB SaaS Platform project, assesses their probability and impact, and defines mitigation strategies to minimize their effect on project success.

### 1.2 Risk Management Process
1. **Risk Identification** - Identify potential risks
2. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate probability and impact
3. **Risk Response Planning** - Define mitigation strategies
4. **Risk Monitoring** - Track and review risks regularly

### 1.3 Risk Scoring
- **Probability:** 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
- **Impact:** 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
- **Risk Score:** Probability × Impact (1-25)
- **Risk Level:**
  - 1-5: Low (Monitor)
  - 6-10: Medium (Plan)
  - 11-15: High (Mitigate)
  - 16-25: Critical (Immediate action)
