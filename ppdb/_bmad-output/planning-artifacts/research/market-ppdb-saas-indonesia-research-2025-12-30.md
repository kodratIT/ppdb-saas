## Customer Insights

### Customer Behavior Patterns

Private educational institutions in Indonesia are increasingly adopting SaaS solutions to automate administrative burdens. Post-pandemic, there is a shift from "optional" to "essential" digital infrastructure. Schools seek "professionalism" as a differentiator against competitors. Families now expect a "seamless experience" where pendaftaran can be done entirely via mobile, reflecting the nationwide high smartphone penetration.

### Pain Points and Challenges

The "Negeri-minded" philosophy is the biggest external challenge; private schools must compete with "perceived free" government schools. Internally, manual data verification often leads to "data fatigue" and errors. Furthermore, digital literacy among parents in remote or tier-2/3 cities can lead to abandonments if the UI is too complex.

### Decision-Making Processes

Decisions for EdTech adoption are typically top-down, driven by the Foundation (Yayasan) Board or the Principal. Key criteria include:

1. **Automation of Selection:** Needs to be objective to avoid "titipan" (referral) controversies.
2. **Integrated Finance:** Must handle VA/E-wallet payments for registration fees.
3. **Local Support:** Accessibility of the vendor via WhatsApp/Technical support is a deal-breaker.

### Customer Journey Mapping

The journey starts with **Awareness** (Social media ads/Word of mouth), follows by **Registration** (Mobile-friendly web form), **Verification** (Real-time WhatsApp notification), **Payment** (Automated VA check), and ends with **Result Announcement** (Digital card printing). Friction in the "Payment" and "Verification" steps often leads to high drop-off rates.

### Competitive Threats

- **Government Monopolies:** If governments extend SIAP PPDB to all swasta schools for free.
- **Feature Creep:** Competitors building payment gateways (like Jibas SchoolPay) faster.
- **Giant EdTechs:** Large players like Ruangguru potentially entering the admission SaaS space.

### Opportunities

- **Regulasi SPMB 2025:** New government efforts to include private schools in official admission cycles create a massive need for integrated, reliable SaaS bridges.
- **Cloudflare/Neon Stack:** Leveraging modern serverless to offer lower subscription costs while maintaining higher performance than legacy SQL/VM based competitors.

## Research Summary and Conclusions

### Executive Summary

The Indonesian PPDB SaaS market is at a turning point with the upcoming 2025 SPMB regulations. While public schools are dominated by traditional players like Telkom, the private sector remains fragmented, tech-hungry, and underserved in terms of performance and marketing integration. The shift towards mobile-first consumption among parents makes high-performance edge computing (the Cloudflare/Neon stack) a major competitive advantage.

### Key Conclusions

1. **Product-Market Fit:** Confirmed. There is a high willingness to pay among private school foundations for systems that improve professionalism and branding.
2. **Competitive Edge:** Speed and Simplicity. Existing systems are often perceived as "clunky" or "complex" to set up.
3. **Primary Risk:** Infrastructure complexity for the development team, which can be mitigated by sticking to established serverless patterns.

### Strategic Recommendations

- Focus on the **Private School Foundation (Yayasan)** segment as the primary entry point.
- Mirror the **SIAP PPDB** compliance features while beating them on **UX and Speed**.
- Use **WhatsApp Integration** as a primary marketing tool for schools to nurture leads.
